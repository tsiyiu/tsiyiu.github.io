# Needed softwares and services of mine

When I need to configure a new computer, I might need the following services and softwares:

_Here I assume that I will only use Debian-based Linuxes in the future_

_If a software can be found in the default or recommended sources of the OS then the name of the software will be displayed in_ `code` _style with the package name. Otherwise it will be_ plain text.



1. Basic tools: Onlyoffice OR WPS Office International (Slight ads), Astrill VPN from <https://getastr.com>, Wechat, Vim (Preinstalled?)
2. Developing: `python3` (May be preinstalled), `rust-all`, `git`, `gh`,`google-android-tools-installer`
3. Maths: `texlive`, `texlive-xelatex` as a $\LaTeX$ compiler, `texstudio` is a $\LaTeX$ editor, `tikzit` for $\TeX$ package tikz, `typora` for MarkDown editing.
4. Firefox extensions are _automatically_ installed once syncing is triggered after logging in. So are the bookmarks.
5. GitHub repository `rime/plum` for installing Cantonese Jyutping IME.
